ggplot2 0.8.8 (2010-XX-XX) ----------------------------------------

* statistics now also respect layer parameter inherit.aes (thanks to bug report by Lorenzo Isella and investigation by Brian Diggs)
* fix ordering bug in facet_wrap (thanks to bug report by Frank Davenport)
* geom_hline and geom_vline will not impact legend when used for fixed intercepts
