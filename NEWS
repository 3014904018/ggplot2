ggplot2 0.8  (2008-XX)
----------------------------------------

* mapping aesthetics to functions of stat output now works in a much wider variety of cases
* scale_x_log10, scale_y_sqrt etc now correctly transform output from statistics as well as raw data
* stat_contour now has arguments to control the position of the contours, rather than relying on the z scale
* scale_z_* now removed because no longer used by anything
* coord_cartesian now correctly clips instead of dropping points outside of its limits
* order aesthetic should now work with bars (and in general more geoms)
* scale_discrete_position: fixed bug when limits were set
* xlim, ylim and zlim now generate a reverse scale if the minimum is greater than the maximum
* grid: correctly expose subcomponents of strips and axes
* ggsave now produces postscript files that are actually suitable for embedding in another document
* ggsave now checks that you are using it with a ggplot plot
* ggsave now recognises the .svg extension and will produce svg files
* theme_grey now aliased to theme_gray
* geom_smooth calls stat::predict explicit to avoid conflicts with packages that override predict for S4 model classes
* geom_path and geom_line gain arrows argument to match geom_segment
* geom_point, geom_pointrange and geom_boxplot: now use shape = 16 instead of 19.  This shape does not have a border from R 2.8 on, and so will look better when displayed transparently.
* xlim and ylim now produce discrete scales when appropriate
* geom_bar, geom_polygon, geom_rect, ...: default fill colour is now much closer to black to match the defaults in other geoms (point, line, etc)
* facet_grid: margins now grouped correctly in default case (non-aesthetic variables ignored when generating default group value)
* theme_bw: tweaks to make black and white theme look a little nicer
* theme_line: setting size works correctly
* theme_rect, theme_segment: size now measured in mm, to be consistent with the rest of ggplot
* theme: panel.empty setting removed as it is no longer used
* theme: new theme setting panel.margin (a unit) controls gap between panels in facetted plots (for both grid and wrap)
* scale_gradient*: axes are correctly labelled when a transformation is used
* scale_discrete_position: more aesthetically pleasing expansion for a wider ranges of plots (picks expansion based on whether or not geom with width used, e.g. bars)
* scale_position: both discrete and continuous gain a new formatter argument to control the default formatting of the axis labels, see also handy numeric formatters: dollar, comma and percent
* facet_wrap: new facetter which wraps a 1d ribbon of panels into 2d
* qplot: now uses facet_wrap if formula looks like ~ a + b (as opposed to a ~ b)
* facet_grid: new support for varying scales in rows and columns
* scale_discrete_position: empty levels are no longer displayed by default, if you want them, use breaks = levels(myfactor)
* ggsave: default dpi changed to 300, on the assumption that you are saving the plot for printing
* scale_gradient: tweak default colours to make more aesthetically pleasing
* geom_bin: gains drop argument to control whether or not 0 count bins should be removed
* geom_hexbin & stat_hexbin: hexagonal binning and drawing
* geom_bin2d: 2d binning
* stat_bin: correctly returns 0 when no observations in a bin (was previously returning NA)
* geom_freqpoly: draws frequency polygons (= stat_bin + geom_line)
* geom_path: lines have squared end
* ggopt now points to ggtheme
* stat_boxplot: deal with yet another new output format from quantreg
