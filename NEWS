* aesthetics: fixed bug when overriding aesthetics with NULL
* annotate: adds layers with legend = FALSE
* coord_equal: correctly place tick marks (Fixes #61)
* documentation: usage statements should now be spread over multiple lines
* fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame: fixed bug when region variable had missing values
* legend: don't try and display legend when unnecessary scale added
* legend: text labels now correctly left-aligned when non-numeric
* scale_date and scale_date_time now work with infinite positions
