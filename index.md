title: ggplot2

ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics, which tries to take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and none of the bad parts. It takes care of many of the fiddly details that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce complex multi-layered graphics.

## Installation

```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

(You'll need to make sure you have the most recent version of R to get the most recent version of ggplot)

## ggplot book

[ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](http://tinyurl.com/ggplot2-book) is now available on amazon.com. It describes the theoretical underpinnings of ggplot2 and shows you how all the pieces fit together. The book gives you an high-level overview of the package that you just can't get from reading the documentation.

You can read sample chapters and download the book code from the [book website](book/).

## Other resources

You might also find the following presentations useful:

* [ggplot2](resources/2007-past-present-future.pdf): past, present and future.
* One hour [ggplot2 workshop](resources/2007-vanderbilt.pdf) given at Vanderbilt, 2007. ([r code](resources/the-grammar.r))

## Training

From time-to-time I offer face-to-face workshops and training seminars. You can see upcoming events at [lookingatdata.com](http://lookingatdata.com).
