Please describe the issue and explain **why** it is a problem, and what output you expect. If you have a question, on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ggplot2) or [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com).

Please include a minimal reprex. The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it: please [help me help you](https://nypdecider.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/help-me-help-you.gif)! If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading "[What is a reprex](https://github.com/jennybc/reprex#what-is-a-reprex)", and follow the advice further down the page. Please do not include session info unless it's explicitly asked for, or you've used `reprex::reprex(..., si = TRUE)` to hide it away.

```r
# insert reprex here
```
